Those files can be moved around while the application is not running.  When launched again, the application will look in the same place and use what files are there.  For example, Apple's Mail uses a preference file, a Mail folder, and other various files, to run properly.  If these files are moved, and new one's moved in to there place, Mail will use them instead.\n\nMiniSwitch takes advantage of this situation.  You set up a list of users, and a list of applications and files to be switched out for those users.\n\nWhen a user is switched to, all listed applications are quit, the selected user's files are moved into the locations where the applications expect them to be, and the previous user's files are moved back to their MiniSwitch folder.  When launched again, those applications will see the new user's files.";
